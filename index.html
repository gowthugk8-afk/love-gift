  "We were classmates from fifth standard to seventh standard, and during those years, we were just friends, nothing more, nothing less.",
  "We talked, laughed, shared classrooms and memories, but at that time, our bond was simple and innocent, without knowing what the future was quietly preparing for us.",
  "Years passed, and life moved forward, but in 2022, everything changed.",
  "During the corona time, when the world slowed down, our WhatsApp conversations brought us closer than ever before.",
  "Long chats, shared thoughts, and conversations — without realizing it, our hearts started to connect deeper and stronger.",
  "We know each other for nine years, and every moment has been a step in building the bond we share today.",
  "Then we joined the same tuition centre, and that closeness grew even more.",
  "You were the one who made me talk like this to a girl, the one who gave me the courage to express myself.",
  "And you were also the first girl who entered my heart as a lover.",
  "I truly believe you are my first love, because I have never loved anyone like this before.",
  "Every effort I make for you comes straight from my heart, honest and pure.",
  "From 2022 onwards, we became inseparable — not just lovers, but best friends who understand each other deeply.",
  "We made a decision together, a promise that we would not go in different directions, but walk the same path, side by side, until our very end.",
  "That decision became the foundation of our bond.",
  "Every moment with you feels precious.",
  "You are a diamond, Vichuve — rare, beautiful, and priceless.",
  "No words can fully explain what you mean to me, because you are my world.",
  "Your love fills my life with meaning, warmth, and purpose.",
  "We know life is not always easy.",
  "There will be joy and sadness, laughter and tears, happiness and fights.",
  "I know I have anger issues, and I know I need to change, not just for you, but for us.",
  "I promise to grow, to become better, and to treat you like the queen you truly are.",
  "I want to assure you that I am not like others, and our life will not be like the past you have seen.",
  "Our life will be gentle, caring, and filled with understanding.",
  "It will be the beautiful life we dreamed of together — built with trust, respect, and endless love.",
  "From 2022 to 2026, we are celebrating four years of deep friendship and two years of our love journey.",
  "Our fights, our happiness, our memories, and our love continue to grow stronger with time.",
  "When we are together, we act like children — playful, carefree, and full of joy.",
  "We forget the world and care only about each other, and that innocence is one of the most beautiful parts of our bond.",
  "This is our story — not perfect, but real.",
  "Not easy, but meaningful.",
  "And it continues with love, laughter, learning, and togetherness.",
  "Let us keep moving forward, enjoying life, holding each other through everything, and creating memories that will last forever.",
  "This bond has no ending until our own ends.",
